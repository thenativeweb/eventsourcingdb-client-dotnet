# eventsourcingdb

The official .NET client SDK for [EventSourcingDB](https://www.eventsourcingdb.io) – a purpose-built database for event sourcing.

EventSourcingDB enables you to build and operate event-driven applications with native support for writing, reading, and observing events. This client SDK provides convenient access to its capabilities in .NET.

For more information on EventSourcingDB, see its [official documentation](https://docs.eventsourcingdb.io/).

This client SDK includes support for [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to spin up EventSourcingDB instances in integration tests. For details, see [Using Testcontainers](#using-testcontainers).

## Getting Started

Install the client SDK:

```shell
dotnet add package EventSourcingDb
```

Import the `Client` class and create an instance by providing the URL of your EventSourcingDB instance and the API token to use:

```csharp
using EventSourcingDb;

var url = new Uri("http://localhost:3000");
var apiToken = "secret";

var client = new Client(url, apiToken);
```

Then call the `PingAsync` method to check whether the instance is reachable. If it is not, the method will throw an exception:

```csharp
await client.PingAsync();
```

Optionally, you might provide a `CancellationToken`.

*Note that `PingAsync` does not require authentication, so the call may succeed even if the API token is invalid.*

If you want to verify the API token, call `VerifyApiTokenAsync`. If the token is invalid, the function will throw an exception:

```csharp
await client.VerifyApiTokenAsync();
```

Optionally, you might provide a `CancellationToken`.

## Writing Events

Call the `WriteEventsAsync` method and provide a collection of events. You do not have to set all event fields – some are automatically added by the server.

Specify `Source`, `Subject`, `Type`, and `Data` according to the [CloudEvents](https://docs.eventsourcingdb.io/fundamentals/cloud-events/) format.

For `Data`, you may provide any object that is serializable to JSON. It is recommended to use properties with JSON attributes to control the serialization.

The method returns a list of written events, including the fields added by the server:

```csharp
var @event = new EventCandidate(
    Source: "https://library.eventsourcingdb.io",
    Subject: "/books/42",
    Type: "io.eventsourcingdb.library.book-acquired",
    Data: new {
        title = "2001 – A Space Odyssey",
        author = "Arthur C. Clarke",
        isbn = "978-0756906788"
    }
);

var writtenEvents = await client.WriteEventsAsync(new[] { @event });
```

*Optionally, you might provide a `CancellationToken`.*

### Using the `IsSubjectPristine` precondition

If you only want to write events in case a subject (such as `/books/42`) does not yet have any events, use the `IsSubjectPristinePrecondition`:

```csharp
var writtenEvents = await client.WriteEventsAsync(
    new[] { @event },
    new[] { Precondition.IsSubjectPristinePrecondition("/books/42") }
);
```

### Using the `IsSubjectOnEventId` precondition

If you only want to write events in case the last event of a subject (such as `/books/42`) has a specific ID (e.g., `"0"`), use the `IsSubjectOnEventIdPrecondition`:

```csharp
var writtenEvents = await client.WriteEventsAsync(
    new[] { @event },
    new[] { Precondition.IsSubjectOnEventIdPrecondition("/books/42", "0") }
);
```

*Note that according to the CloudEvents standard, event IDs must be of type string.*

### Using the `IsEventQlQueryTrue` precondition

If you want to write events depending on an EventQL query, use the `IsEventQlQueryTruePrecondition`:

```csharp
var writtenEvents = await client.WriteEventsAsync(
    new[] { @event },
    new[] { Precondition.IsEventQlQueryTruePrecondition("FROM e IN events WHERE e.type == 'io.eventsourcingdb.library.book-borrowed' PROJECT INTO COUNT() < 10") }
);
```

*Note that the query must return a single row with a single value, which is interpreted as a boolean.*

## Reading Events

To read all events of a subject, call the `ReadEventsAsync` method and pass the subject and an options object. Set `Recursive` to `false` to ensure that only events of the given subject are returned, not events of nested subjects.

The method returns an async stream, which you can iterate over using `await foreach`:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ReadEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ReadEventsOptions(Recursive: false)))
{
    // Handle event
}
```

If an error occurs, the stream will terminate with an exception.

*Optionally, you might provide a `CancellationToken`.*

#### Deserializing Event Data

Each event contains a `Data` property, which holds the event payload as JSON. To deserialize this payload into a strongly typed object, call `GetData<T>()`:

```csharp
var book = @event.GetData<BookAcquired>();
```

Alternatively, you can use the non-generic overload `GetData(Type)` to resolve the type at runtime:

```csharp
var type = typeof(BookAcquired);
var book = (BookAcquired)@event.GetData(type)!;
```

If you prefer to work directly with the JSON structure, access the `Data` property as a `JsonElement`:

```csharp
var title = @event.Data.GetProperty("title").GetString();
```

### Reading from subjects recursively

If you want to read not only all events of a subject, but also the events of all nested subjects, set `Recursive` to `true`:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ReadEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ReadEventsOptions(Recursive: true)))
{
    // ...
}
```

This also allows you to read *all* events ever written by using `/` as the subject.

### Reading in anti-chronological order

By default, events are read in chronological order. To read in anti-chronological order, use the `Order` option:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ReadEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ReadEventsOptions(
        Recursive: false,
        Order: Order.Antichronological)))
{
    // ...
}
```

*Note that you can also use `Order.Chronological` to explicitly enforce the default order.*

### Specifying bounds

If you only want to read a range of events, set the `LowerBound` and `UpperBound` options — either one of them or both:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ReadEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ReadEventsOptions(
        Recursive: false,
        LowerBound: new Bound("100", BoundType.Inclusive),
        UpperBound: new Bound("200", BoundType.Exclusive))))
{
    // ...
}
```

### Starting from the latest event of a given type

To start reading from the latest event of a specific type, set the `FromLatestEvent` option:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ReadEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ReadEventsOptions(
        Recursive: false,
        FromLatestEvent: new ReadFromLatestEvent(
            Subject: "/books/42",
            Type: "io.eventsourcingdb.library.book-borrowed",
            IfEventIsMissing: ReadIfEventIsMissing.ReadEverything))))
{
    // ...
}
```

*Note that `FromLatestEvent` and `LowerBound` cannot be used at the same time.*

## Observing Events

To observe all future events of a subject, call the `ObserveEventsAsync` method and pass the subject and an options object. Set `Recursive` to `false` to observe only the events of the given subject.

The method returns an async stream:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ObserveEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ObserveEventsOptions(Recursive: false)))
{
    // Handle event
}
```

If an error occurs, the stream will terminate with an exception.

*Optionally, you might provide a `CancellationToken`.*

#### Deserializing Event Data

Each event contains a `Data` property, which holds the event payload as JSON. To deserialize this payload into a strongly typed object, call `GetData<T>()`:

```csharp
var book = @event.GetData<BookAcquired>();
```

Alternatively, you can use the non-generic overload `GetData(Type)` to resolve the type at runtime:

```csharp
var type = typeof(BookAcquired);
var book = (BookAcquired)@event.GetData(type)!;
```

If you prefer to work directly with the JSON structure, access the `Data` property as a `JsonElement`:

```csharp
var title = @event.Data.GetProperty("title").GetString();
```

### Observing from subjects recursively

If you want to observe not only the events of a subject, but also events of all nested subjects, set `Recursive` to `true`:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ObserveEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ObserveEventsOptions(Recursive: true)))
{
    // ...
}
```

This also allows you to observe *all* events ever written by using `/` as the subject.

### Specifying bounds

If you want to start observing from a certain point, set the `LowerBound` option:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ObserveEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ObserveEventsOptions(
        Recursive: false,
        LowerBound: new Bound("100", BoundType.Inclusive))))
{
    // ...
}
```

### Starting from the latest event of a given type

To observe starting from the latest event of a specific type, use the `FromLatestEvent` option:

```csharp
await foreach (var @event in client.ObserveEventsAsync(
    "/books/42",
    new ObserveEventsOptions(
        Recursive: false,
        FromLatestEvent: new ObserveFromLatestEvent(
            Subject: "/books/42",
            Type: "io.eventsourcingdb.library.book-borrowed",
            IfEventIsMissing: ObserveIfEventIsMissing.ReadEverything))))
{
    // ...
}
```

*Note that `FromLatestEvent` and `LowerBound` cannot be used at the same time.*

## Listing Event Types

To list all event types, call the `ReadEventTypesAsync` method. The method returns an async stream:

```csharp
await foreach (var eventType in client.ReadEventTypesAsync())
{
    // ...
}
```

## Listing a Specific Event Type

To list a specific event type, call the `ReadEventTypeAsync` method with the event type as an argument. The method returns the detailed event type, which includes the schema:

```csharp
var eventType = await client.ReadEventTypeAsync("io.eventsourcingdb.library.book-acquired");
```

## Using Testcontainers

Import the `Container` class, create an instance, call the `StartAsync` method to run a test container, get a client, run your test code, and finally call the `StopAsync` method to stop the test container:

```csharp
using EventSourcingDb;

var container = new Container();
await container.StartAsync();

var client = container.GetClient();

// ...

await container.StopAsync();
```

Optionally, you might provide a `CancellationToken` to the `StartAsync` and `StopAsync` methods.

To check if the test container is running, call the `IsRunning` method:

```csharp
var isRunning = container.IsRunning();
```

#### Configuring the Container Instance

By default, `Container` uses the `latest` tag of the official EventSourcingDB Docker image. To change that, call the `WithImageTag` method:

```csharp
var container = new Container()
    .WithImageTag("1.0.0");
```

Similarly, you can configure the port to use and the API token. Call the `WithPort` or the `WithApiToken` method respectively:

```csharp
var container = new Container()
    .WithPort(4000)
    .WithApiToken("secret");
```

#### Configuring the Client Manually

In case you need to set up the client yourself, use the following methods to get details on the container:

- `GetHost()` returns the host name
- `GetMappedPort()` returns the port
- `GetBaseUrl()` returns the full URL of the container
- `GetApiToken()` returns the API token
